# MEAN Starter Kit using Docker Compose

> This project is based on ideas gathered from projects linked to in the [References](#references) section but simplified to fit my purpose of quickly starting up a project and customizing it for a general purpose website that supports user registration and authentication. It uses Angular 2 with webpack for the client side, Node.js with Express for the server side, and MongoDB for data storage. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is used for authentication.

## Prerequisites
